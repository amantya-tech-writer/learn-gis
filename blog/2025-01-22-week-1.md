I've recently taken on the responsibility of creating and refining the VertiGIS documentationâ€”including UI guidelines, REST API references, and SDK usage.

It's an exciting role that involves ensuring developers and users can easily leverage our solutions.

## Types of Documentation

I've been having an awesome experience exploring different aspects of technical writing. Working on VertiGIS UI documentation, REST API references, and the SDK has broadened my understanding of how users interact with our tools. It's rewarding to see how clear, concise docs can help everyone be more productive.

Here are some documentation types I'm working on:

- UI guidelines and design patterns
- REST API references
- SDK usage guides
- Step-by-step tutorials

## Tools that I'm using

Here are the main tools I'm using for documentation:

- **VS Code**: Primary editor for markdown and code samples
- **Postman**: Testing and documenting REST API endpoints
- **pgAdmin**: Managing database documentation
- **ArcGIS**: Creating map examples and spatial references
- **VertiGIS Studio**: Working with product-specific features
- **Docusaurus**: Building and maintaining the documentation site
- **Git/GitHub**: Version control and collaboration

Each tool serves a specific purpose in creating comprehensive, accurate documentation.
