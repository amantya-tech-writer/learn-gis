## Vector is Corrector.

Object data model:

- generalization
- represent real things as locations and attributes
- objects = conceptualizations of real items
- concrete or abstract

```json
{
    "type": "Feature",
    "geometry": {
        "type": "Point",
        "coordinates": [77.230004, 28.6947]
    },
    "properties": {
        "name": "Majnu ka Tilla",
        "type": "food joints",
        "rating": 4.5,
        "state": "Delhi",
        "country": "India"
    }
}
```

| Restaurant Name | Coordinates | Food Type | Cost (1-5) | Hours | Capacity | Rating |
|----------------|-------------|------------|------------|-------|----------|---------|
| Ama Restaurant | [77.2305, 28.6948] | Tibetan, Chinese | 2 | 11AM-10PM | 40 | 4.3 |
| Dolma House | [77.2307, 28.6945] | Tibetan | 2 | 10AM-9PM | 25 | 4.4 |
| AMA Cafe | [77.2306, 28.6947] | Cafe, Breakfast | 3 | 8AM-9PM | 30 | 4.6 |

| Busan Korean | [77.2305, 28.6949] | Korean | 4 | 12PM-11PM | 45 | 4.5 |

> Rester is faster, but vector is corrector.

Vector caclculations:

- re-projection is precise
- reliably stores:
 - point overvations
 - edges
 - boundaries
- attributes stay reliable if joined properly

## Raster is Faster.

Raster data model:

Raster alignment:

- location, grid of values
- raster become difficult when comparing locations (10m cell size vs 15m cell size)
- need to decide which cells should overlap

Raster re-projection:

- introduces errors
- lossy data
- less precise than vector

Multiband raster:

- rasters can be stacked to work with multiple rasters as if they're one.
- each "band" is a single raster.
- ex: represent data from different sensors captured at the same time.
