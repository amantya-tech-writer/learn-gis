# Data Organization and Relationships

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Primary Keys**

A **primary key (PK)** is a unique identifier for each record in a table. It ensures that no two rows have the same value for the primary key column.

#### Example:

| Students Table     |
|--------------------|
| StudentID (PK)     |
| Name               |
| Grade              |

- **StudentID** is the primary key. Each student has a unique ID.

---

### 2. **Foreign Keys**

A **foreign key (FK)** is a column in one table that references the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables.

#### Example:

| Grades Table       |
|--------------------|
| GradeID (PK)       |
| StudentID (FK)     |
| Subject            |
| Score              |

- **StudentID** in the `Grades` table is a foreign key that references the `StudentID` in the `Students` table.

---

### 3. **One-to-Many Relationships**

A **one-to-many relationship** occurs when a single record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table.

#### Example:

| Stations Table     | Measurements Table |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| StationID (PK)     | ReadingID (PK)     |
| Location           | StationID (FK)     |
| Elevation          | Temperature        |
|                    | Date               |

- One weather station (`StationID`) can have many temperature measurements.

---

### 4. **Many-to-Many Relationships**

A **many-to-many relationship** occurs when multiple records in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table. This requires an intermediary table (also called a junction table).

#### Example:

| Observers Table    | Observations Table | Observer_Observations Table |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| ObserverID (PK)    | ObservationID (PK) | ObserverID (FK)             |
| FirstName          | Site_ID (FK)       | ObservationID (FK)          |
| LastName           | Velocity           |                             |
|                    | Depth              |                             |
|                    | Date               |                             |

- Multiple observers can be associated with multiple observations through the `Observer_Observations` table.

## Practical Examples

### 1. **Real Estate Database**

- **Tables:**
  - `Properties`: Stores property details.
  - `Transactions`: Stores sales records.

| Properties Table | Transactions Table |
|------------------|--------------------|
| PropertyID (PK)  | TransactionID (PK) |
| Address          | PropertyID (FK)    |
| Features         | SaleDate           |
|                  | SalePrice          |

**Explanation:**
- Each property has a unique `PropertyID`.
- Each transaction references a property using `PropertyID` as a foreign key.

---

### 2. **School Management System**

**Tables:**
- `Students`: Stores student details.
- `Grades`: Stores grades for each student.

| Students Table     | Grades Table       |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| StudentID (PK)     | GradeID (PK)       |
| Name               | StudentID (FK)     |
| Grade              | Subject            |
|                    | Score              |

**Explanation:**
- Each student has a unique `StudentID`.
- Each grade record references a student using `StudentID` as a foreign key.

---

### 3. **River Monitoring System**

**Tables:**
- `Sites`: Stores river monitoring sites.
- `Observations`: Stores observations for each site.

| Sites Table        | Observations Table |
|--------------------|--------------------|
| ID (PK)            | ID (PK)            |
| Shape              | Site_ID (FK)       |
| Site_Name          | Velocity           |
|                    | Depth              |
|                    | Observer           |
|                    | Date               |

**Explanation:**
- Each site has a unique `ID`.
- Each observation references a site using `Site_ID` as a foreign key.

---

### 4. **Advanced Example: Many-to-Many Relationship**

**Tables:**
- `Observers`: Stores observer details.
- `Observations`: Stores observation details.
- `Observer_Observations`: Links observers to observations.

| Observers Table    | Observations Table | Observer_Observations Table |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| ObserverID (PK)    | ObservationID (PK) | ObserverID (FK)             |
| FirstName          | Site_ID (FK)       | ObservationID (FK)          |
| LastName           | Velocity           |                             |
|                    | Depth              |                             |
|                    | Date               |                             |

- **Explanation:**
  - Multiple observers can be associated with multiple observations.
  - The `Observer_Observations` table acts as a bridge between the two tables.

---

## Summary

- **Primary Keys** uniquely identify records in a table.
- **Foreign Keys** establish relationships between tables.
- **One-to-Many Relationships** link a single record in one table to multiple records in another.
- **Many-to-Many Relationships** require an intermediary table to link multiple records across tables.

## Practice Exercise

1. Create a database schema for a **Library Management System** with the following tables:
   - `Books` (BookID, Title, Author)
   - `Members` (MemberID, Name, Email)
   - `Borrowings` (BorrowingID, BookID, MemberID, BorrowDate, ReturnDate)

2. Identify the primary keys and foreign keys in your schema.
3. Determine the relationships between the tables (one-to-many or many-to-many).
